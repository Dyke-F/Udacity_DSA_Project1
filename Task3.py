    TASK 3:
    (080) is the area code for fixed line telephones in Bangalore.
    Fixed line numbers include parentheses, so Bangalore numbers
    have the form (080)xxxxxxx.)
    
    Part A: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
    in Bangalore.
    - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area
    codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
    - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle
    of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number
    is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
    - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start
    with the area code 140.
    
    Print the answer as part of a message:
    "The numbers called by people in Bangalore have codes:"
    <list of codes>
    The list of codes should be print out one per line in lexicographic order with no duplicates.
    
    Part B: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
    to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made
    from a number starting with "(080)", what percentage of these calls
    were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?
    
    Print the answer as a part of a message::
    "<percentage> percent of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are calls
    to other fixed lines in Bangalore."
    The percentage should have 2 decimal digits
